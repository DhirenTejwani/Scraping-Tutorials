{"title": "Lei: A Gift of Love", "content": "May 14\n\t  Lei: A Gift of Love\n\tNo Comments \u00bb\n\t  \n\t\tLei are often worn by Hula Dancers during performances. You have probably seen beautiful lei made of various colorful flowers, kukui nuts, t-leaf, shells or even seeds. In modern Hawaii, lei are often given at airports and special events to greet visitors. Natives of Hawaii give a lei to their loved ones for birthdays, graduations, special events, and celebrations.\nThe lei custom was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by early Polynesian voyagers. In ancient Hawaii, lei were made of feathers, leaves, shells, flowers, nuts, seeds, and bones/teeth of various animals. Ancient Hawaiians wore these garlands to beautify themselves. Some lei had a significant meaning. The Maile lei, made of a green vine, was used to signify peace between opposing chiefs. The chiefs would intertwine Maile lei signifying peace between the two groups.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is perfectly acceptable to wear a lei on any given day; there does not need to be a special occasion. A lei may be purchased from a store of a lei maker, or you may string one yourself. Lei may be worn around your neck, or even around a hat. A lei is a symbol of affection. Therefore, it is considered rude to refuse a lei when it is being given to you. It is also considered impolite to remove a lei from your neck in front of the person who gave it to you.\n\n\u00a0\nToday the lei is a symbol of Hawaii to millions of visitors around the world. Hawaii Hula Company is proud to offer lei greeting for special events to welcome your guests in a unique way!\n\t  "},

{"title": "Pele- Goddess of Fire", "content": "Apr 15\n\t  Pele- Goddess of Fire\n\tNo Comments \u00bb\n\t  \n\t\tEvery Hula chant or song tells a story. Luckily, a Hula Dancer can portray the story with his/her hands, so you don\u2019t need to be fluent in the Hawaiian language to understand the stories. A Hula Dancer can make you feel like you\u2019re apart of the story through expressions and movements.\nThere are many Hawaiian chants inviting you to follow the adventures of Pele, the goddess of fire. Until this day, volcanic eruptions on Hawaii Island are attributed to Pele longing to be with her loved one. Some of the most popular Pele legends involve Pele and her lover Lohiau, a chief of Kaua`i, and Pele\u2019s youngest and favorite sister, Hi`iaka.\nPele is said to be the most visible of the Hawaiian gods/goddesses as she dwells in the craters of the active Kilauea Volcano. The legends of Pele represent her as a very passionate and volatile goddess. She has the ability to create, as well as destroy land.\nThe spirit of Madame Pele is highly respected by natives of Hawaii. There are modern day stories of people believing to spot Pele. One story says drivers have seen an old woman dressed in all white on the roads of Kilauea National Park on Hawaii Island. The woman is said to be accompanied by a small dog. After drivers pick her up, they say the backseat is empty when they look back in the mirror. Locals also try to spread awareness about the importance of showing respect when visiting the lava fields. People of Hawai`i frown upon taking lava rocks from the volcanoes. There was a very recent story in 2016 of an American family who took handfuls of lava rocks and black sand from the Big Island. After feeling \u201ccursed\u201d they contacted the local airlines they flew with and had the stolen items retuned to Madame Pele.\nKumu Hula (teachers) often take their haumana (students) to visit places which their mele (songs) and chants come from. The more a dancer understands what they\u2019re dancing about, the better they can express it. The legends of Hawaii\u2019s gods and goddesses are fascinating, and can be best experienced through the art of Hula.\n\t  "},

Hula Dancers around the world will be tuning in to catch the competition live. The competition can be viewed live in person from Hilo Hawai`i, online from anywhere in the world, or on television from anywhere in Hawai`i.\nThis year, the festival kicks off on April 16, 2017. The festival honors King David Kalakaua (the last king of the Kingdom of Hawaii,) whose nickname was \u201cThe Merrie Monarch.\u201d King Kalakaua is well known and celebrated in the Hawaiian Islands for restoring the Hula after it was banned by the missionaries.\nThe Merrie Monarch greatly impacts the Hawaiian people as it perpetuates our traditional Hawaiian culture. The competition strives to share high quality performances with interested people around the world. Hula Dancers train and practice for extensive amounts of time before they showcase a song. The Merrie Monarch represents a celebration of Hula, and fosters an appreciation of dance in our future generations.\nThe competition officially begins on Thursday with the soloist category. 10 women, from 10 different Halau (hula school) will be competing to become Miss. Aloha Hula, your modern day \u201cHula champion.\u201d On Friday all of the groups will dance their chosen Kahiko (ancient/traditional) number, and on Saturday each group will perform an auana (modern) number. Each student is taught that it\u2019s an honor to enter the competition, and that it\u2019s more about representing your kumu (teacher) to your best ability rather than winning.\nWill you be tuning in to partake in the Merrie Monarch festivities, or will you be attending the festival in person?\n\u00a0\n\t  "},

Believe it or not, the art of Hula is not the most important thing you learn during your time in a Hula Halau.\nImagine this: It\u2019s 11:00 am on a Saturday morning and it\u2019s time for practice. All of the other haumana (students) are in line ready to go, but you are stumbling out of your car because you left your house 5 minutes late. Practice begins, and you are now officially late. Out of respect for your Kumu (teacher,) you pull yourself together and calmly walk over to the Halau where you need to oli (Hawaiian chant) permission to enter. You do the oli 3 times in a row, but because your Kumu is busy with the punctual students, you take a deep breath and do it again; this time chanting louder with more power in your voice. Your Kumu finally gives you permission to enter the Halau. *Note to self- Always be punctual\nWe begin with a Hula warm-up that we call \u201cbasics.\u201d We practice our basic steps and our Kumu helps us make corrections as needed. This is to help fine-tune our skills. Your knees are bent and after an intense 30-minute drill they start to ache. You think you\u2019re finally done and you\u2019ve made it, when it\u2019s announced that the final basic drills involve the dreaded o`opa (duck walk,) and the infamous Hula roll (A Hula roll involves sitting in between your legs on the ground and rolling your body around in a circle without the use of your elbows.) Your body feels like it could break. Your knees are shaking, and you start to get light headed as you power through these dreaded drills that are necessary to shape you as a dancer. *Note to self- You are stronger than you think; you can do anything you set your mind to.\nIn a Hula Hulau you are surrounded by tons of children who may be older than you, younger than you, and the same age as you. These are the people you rely on during practices, shows, and competitions. You grow so close to one another that you refer to each other as Hula brothers and Hula sisters. These children teach you teamwork, trust, and eternal love. They say once the stage lights come on dancers become multiple souls in one body. That\u2019s because dancer\u2019s movements should be in complete precision. Basically, when we dance Hula together, we are one. *Note to self- Always strive for your best; your brothers and sisters are counting on you.\nHula dancers are raised with respect for the Hawaiian culture, the land, and for all living things. Hula dancers learn discipline, and tend to have polite mannerisms. Hula dancers are raised with the strong Hawaiian value of aloha (love!) To be a great Hula dancer one must not only dance to make their Kumu (teacher) proud, but one must also exude the values and strength of a true Hula dancer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t  "},

There was a time period where my great, great grandparents practiced Hula and the Hawaiian language in secrecy because missionaries outlawed it. Today, I\u2019m able to proudly perform this dance for locals and tourists in Hawai`i, as well as various cities around the world. People fall in love with hula for various reasons.

King David Kalakaua once said: \u201cHula is the language of the heart, therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\u201d Hula is even taught to the children of Hawai`i in public and private schools.

A Hula Dancer\u2019s day is usually filled with happiness and joy, as we are able to celebrate many special occasions, and be apart of people\u2019s noteworthy moments. Allow me to take you on a walk through my day.\nMy day started at sunrise down on the beach where the ocean meets the sand. As the sun rose, and the birds chirped, I danced to the sweet sound of my favorite musician playing his ukulele. After my opening hula I watched 6 couples, from 6 different countries, renew their vows as they openly shared their love for one another. The sunrise vow renewal ceremony gave my body more caffeine than a cup of my daily Starbucks.\nFollowing the early morning start I treated myself to a beautiful Hawaiian hike before my next gig. A few hours later, I met up with two of my closest friends to dance as a trio at one of O`ahu\u2019s secluded, high-end hotels. We shared the stage with three of our usual, talented musicians. The six of us worked together to deliver a high-energy show. After the show we were invited to eat the left over food and mingle with our guests, who came from Australia. They were celebrating a 25th wedding anniversary. Having recently traveled through Australia, we had a ton to converse about. We shared travel tips, and wished them well before heading down to end the evening at the well-known Waikiki strip.\nAs I pulled into my last gig of the evening at a prestigious Waikiki hotel, fireworks going off over the ocean greeted me. Although I grew up about 10 minutes from Waikiki, the magic of Waikiki that you hear about in many Hawaiian songs never gets old. I met up with two of my musicians excited to begin my last show of the evening. After my first hula a pair of adorable sisters approached me. The girls were dolled up in Hawaiian print dresses with flowers in their hair. Although they were both under five years old, they were extremely friendly and conversational. We became an instant group of besties, and they decided to sit with me until my next set. Their polite parents were worried that they were in the way, but I insisted they were just fine. When I went up for my second set I surprised the girls by calling them up to do a hula with me. Their parents smiled and recorded their daughters dancing a song about seashells under the bright Hawaiian moon. As a hula dancer, one of the things I value most is the happiness I\u2019m able to share with others, and these girls couldn\u2019t contain their smiles.\nThe day of a Hawaiian performer is typically fueled by passion, energy, laughter, the love of people, and dance. The next time you see a Hula Dancer\u2019s radiant smile you\u2019ll be able to relate to his/her daily experiences, and know that you are contributing factor to that display of pearly whites.\n\u00a0\n\t  "},

Although aloha means hello, goodbye, and love; essentially it\u2019s a way of life. Aloha spirit is exuded throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Aloha spirit is a guideline to act rightfully.

Literally translated, aloha is \u201cthe presence of breath,\u201d or \u201cthe breath of life.\u201d \u201cAlo\u201d means presence, and \u201cha\u201d means breath.\nHula is an expression of aloha\nHaumana (students) are taught about aloha from a young age at their halau (hula school.) It is a hula dancer\u2019s kuleana (responsibility) to understand the meaning of aloha in order to share it with others. When a hula dancer presents you with a lei (flowers/shells strung together to be worn,) he/she is sharing a symbol of affection, and is genuinely welcoming you with open arms.\nGiving a lei is a symbol of aloha\nIn ancient Hawai`i, kahuna (priests) embedded the spirit of aloha in the Hawaiian people. It was said that self-perfection could be reached by fully living by the spirit of aloha. The Hawaiians lived in harmony within their ahupua`a (land division,) each perfecting their skills and sharing everything with one another.\n\nInterestingly enough, not only has the aloha spirit been kept alive and well in Hawai`i, but it is also a law. That\u2019s right! Aloha spirit is an official law in the state of Hawai`i. The official Aloha Spirit Law can be found in section 5-7.5. The law states: \u201cAll citizens and government officials of Hawaii are obligated by law to conduct themselves in accordance with this law, while performing their duties and obligations, as well as in their day-to-day living.

However, each dance is associated with a specific island group, and is special to a specific culture. Hula comes from the islands of Hawai`i, Tahitian derives from the islands of Tahiti, the Haka and Poi Balls originated in New Zealand, and fire knife dancing comes from Samoa. Although these dances may often be seen performed back to back in a Polynesian show, they are unique, and represent various cultures.\nHula Kahiko\nHula is the dance of the Native Hawaiians. You may see beautiful graceful Hula Auana, or strong and powerful Hula Kahiko. Legend says that the Hula was originally performed for Pele, the goddess of fire, by her sister, Hi`iaka. Many Hula chants are an oral record of the history of Hawai`i. The Hula has greatly changed over the years, but its\u2019 ancient roots are still portrayed in the dance. After the arrival of missionaries on the Hawaiian Islands in 1820, hula was banned. Although the dance was somewhat revived years later for the purpose of religious freedom, King David Kalakaua is credited for the full revival of the hula during his reign between 1874-1891. The art of Hula is credited for preserving the culture of the Native Hawaiians. Hula is well respected throughout the Hawaiian Islands, and can be seen at various events.\nTahitian Dancers\nOri Tahiti (Tahitian dance) is the dance of the Tahitian people. You may see the Otea, which consists of gyrating hip movements to drumming, or the Aparima, which tells a story through song. Tahitian people are known to love song and dance. In ancient times, the native people of Tahiti would perform various dances for special occasions. There was a dance to greet visitors at a ceremony, dances for prayer and worship, and other dances dedicated to ancient gods. Similar to the history of Hawai`i, upon arrival of the missionaries, they banned all songs, games, and dances- as they viewed them as vulgar. Ori Tahiti wasn\u2019t revived until the 1950\u2019s; over a hundred years after it was suppressed by British colonists. Tahitian dance is well and alive today. Many people consider the Tahitian O`tea one of the most spectacular dances of Polynesia.\nThe Haka is one of New Zeland\u2019s traditional dances. There are many forms of the Haka. One of the most popular is the \u201cKa Mate.\u201d The Haka portrays strong, war like gestures. Historically, the Haka was performed for a variety of purposes ranging from preparing for battle to funeral services. Another dance of the Maori people is called Poi. Poi balls are weighted balls connected to string. They can be long or short. Poi tells a story while the dancer creates rhythmic and geometric patterns with the poi balls.\nFire Knife Dancer\nThe fiery fire knife dance comes from Samoa. It has been passed on from generation to generation. The dance involves the brave twirling of a war knife. Traditionally the dance was used in ancient time to prepare a warrior\u2019s mind for battle. Today\u2019s fire knife dancers have added additional style and boldness to their performance.\nAlthough the islands of Polynesia may share some similarities, each island is unique, having many differences. The dances of each specific island is special to its\u2019 people. Each dance is distinguished and beloved by its\u2019 specific culture.\n\t  Hula KahikoTahitian DancersFire Knife Dancer"},

Costumes range from traditional hula skirts to elegant dresses, to brightly colored cellophane skirts.\nPerforming a traditional Hula Kahiko\nHula Kahiko: The Hula Kahiko is the traditional style of dance. Originally, only men would perform the Hula, but today both men and women enjoy dancing. Kahiko is performed to chants instead of music. The chants are usually accompanied by a pahu (drum) or an ipu (hollowed gourd) to keep the rhythm. Men often wear a malo (loincloth) while performing Hula Kahiko while women typically wear voluminous skirts. The Hula Kahiko is a very powerful dance that requires strength and discipline from the dancer. The chants often speak about Hawaiian legends and gods. Kahiko adornments are made from foliage and are typically worn around a dancer\u2019s head, neck, wrists, and ankles.\nPerforming a modern Hula Auana\nHula `Auana: The Hula `Auana the modern style of dance performed by both men and women.

However, many often question what it takes to be a professional Hula Dancer. The truth is, anyone who decides to enter the realm of professional hula dancing has a great passion for the unique, complex art form, and is eager to share the love of Hula with locals and visitors, alike.\nThe Ladies of Hawaii Hula Company\nHula is taught in a halau, which is a school for Hula. Children as young as two attend classes where both Hula Kahiko (ancient style of dance) and Hula \u2018Auana (modern style of dance) are taught. Students in a halau form a close bond with their Kumu Hula (teacher) as well as the other students, which they refer to as their hula brothers and sisters. Years upon years of practice provide haumana (hula students) with the discipline, knowledge, and aloha they need to be successful Hula Dancers. Many halau perform at community events and festivals or train for Hula competitions to showcase their learning.\nHula Halau focus on hula basics. It is not uncommon for students to practice a basic skill until their kumu is satisfied with their performance. Students will also practice the same songs and chants repeatedly to perfect them.\nHula dances may be performed with a dancer\u2019s hands, or utilizing implements. The most common implements are the \u2018uli\u2019uli (Hawaiian feathered rattles,) pu\u2019ili (split bamboo sticks,) and ipu (hand held calabash gourd.) However, dancers may also utilize kala\u2019au (dancing rhythm sticks,) \u2018ili\u2019ili (smooth lava rock castanets,) or a puniu (knee drum.)\nAloha from Oahu\u2019s brand new mall, Ka Makana Ali\u2019i\nNext time you\u2019re gazing at a group of Hula dancers wondering how they learned how to dance, how long they\u2019ve practiced for, or what made them become a professional Hula Dancer, just know it took them a lot of heart and soul as well as many years of dedication and determination. Hula becomes such a great part of a dancer that it becomes who they are instead of what they do. Most importantly, not only does a Hula Dancer share his/her culture and passion with you when they perform for you, but they also joyfully share a piece of themselves.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t  The Ladies of Hawaii Hula CompanyAloha from Oahu\u2019s brand new mall, Ka Makana Ali\u2019i"},

Additionally, music, dancing, singing and sporting events have always held an important place within the Polynesian communities.\u00a0In ancient times, dance was one of the most sophisticated and ritualized art forms performed in both groups and individually.\nIn the 19th Century, Christian missionaries condemned these demonstrations that were described as an erotic form of debauchery. In the year 1819, King Pomare II legally forbade the practice. At that time, after being banished from public areas, dancing became a clandestine practice for the people.\u00a0Traditional dance made resurgence in 1881 after being severely restricted for several decades. That year, the first Heiva I Tahiti was organized and named Tiurai, meaning \u201cJuly the month of festivities.\u201d\nMore than just a simple festival, Heiva I Tahiti has become the symbol of the Polynesian culture and an iconic event for a people proud of their heritage.\u00a0These performances highlight the drama of an opera and the distinct imprints of an ancestral tradition.

Many of these legends include our ancient volcano goddess Pele.\n\nOne day in the times of old the goddess Pele journeyed through the forest near the home of the handsome Ohi\u2019a and spied the young man at work. Pele was smitten by him, and decided to engage with him in conversation. Ohi\u2019a spoke politely and was warm towards the beautiful woman, but did not respond to her flirtation, which upset Pele greatly. She was determined to have this young man for herself, but before she could renew her efforts, Lehua came to the place her young husband was working to bring him his midday meal.\nWhen he saw his lovely wife, Ohi\u2019a\u2019s face lit up with love. He dropped everything at once and went to her side, leaving a fuming Pele to stare in jealous rage at the young couple. Dropping her human disguise, the goddess transformed into a raging column of fire and struck Ohi\u2019a down, transforming him into a twisted ugly tree in revenge for spurning her advances.\nLehua fell to her knees beside the twisted tree that had once been her husband. Tears streaming down her lovely face, she begged Pele to turn him back into a man or else turn her into a tree, as she could not bear to be separated from her beloved. But Pele ignored the girl, taking herself up to the cool heights, her anger satisfied. But the gods saw what Pele had done to the innocent lovers and were angry. As Lehua lay weeping in despair, the gods reached down and transformed the girl into a beautiful red flower, which they placed upon the twisted Ohi\u2019a tree, so that she and her beloved husband would never more be apart.\nFrom that day to this, the Ohi\u2019a tree has blossomed with the beautiful red Lehua flowers. While the flowers remain on the tree, the weather remains sunny and fair. But when a flower is plucked from the tree, then heavy rain falls upon the land like tears, for Lehua still cannot bear to be separated from her beloved husband Ohi\u2019a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hula is significant to these legends because it is one of the ways in which the Hawaiian people keep record of such tales.

For the men of Tahiti, the focus of their dance comes from the rapid shaking of their knees and legs. As for the women of Tahiti, most of the focus is on the movement of their hips. The hip movements will sometimes move very smooth and slow and sometimes very fast. There are generally two types of Tahitian dances, Ote\u2019a, which includes very rapid drumbeats and hip movements, and the Aparima, which normally includes very smooth and very slow hip movements. Tamure or formally known as \u2018Upa\u2019upa is a co-ed type of dance with both male and female dancers.

The beginning of Slack Key Guitar.\n\tNo Comments \u00bb\n\t  \n\t\tHire Hawaiian Musicians\n\u00a0\nA Story of Hawaiian Music. The beginning of Slack Key Guitar.\nby Owana Salazar\n\u00a0\nHawaiian Slack Key is a style of playing the guitar that utilizes open tunings or variations of tunings. An excellent player can also achieve the unique slack key sound in standard tuning.\u00a0 It is a distinctive sound, characteristic to modern Hawaiian music, that finds its roots in the days of the Hawaiian Cowboy or Paniolo and, yes, the Hawaiian Cowgirl or Paniola.\nThe fascinating story is shared, that King Kamehameha the Great received a gift of a small number of cattle from the explorer and friend, Captain Vancouver.\u00a0 Because the cattle were so rare, the king created a law that they were to roam free and remain unharmed.\u00a0 As everything in Hawaii flourishes so well, the cattle multiplied and multiplied and it eventually became necessary to control the huge resulting population.\u00a0 By that time Kamehameha the Great had passed on and Hawaii was governed by his son, Kauikeaouli, known as King Kamehameha III.\u00a0 The good king sent for the Vaqueros to come to Hawaii in order to teach the Hawaiian men everything there was to know about cattle and ranching.\n\nI can just imagine what it might have been like in those days\u2026 Way up, on the slopes of Mauna Kea and the plains of Waimea, or in the lighter forested areas of Panaewa and Opihikao.\u00a0 By day, building fences, driving the cattle into herds, daily committing themselves, to do everything it took to bring order to the chaos of those wild animals.\u00a0 Hard work is deserving of rewards.\u00a0 At night, they made fires to cook their food and gathered around them to keep warm.\u00a0 While gathered around the warming campfires, the Vaqueros would bring out their guitars and play their music.\u00a0 What a wonder it must have been to have first experienced what beauty could come out of a wooden box!\u00a0 A sound never heard before and sweet melodies to calm the wild cattle.\nHire Hawaiian Musicians\nMusic is a universal language and with all that working together everyone had to find a way to communicate with one another.\u00a0 I suppose there were some who enthusiastically learned each language enough to translate.\u00a0 But I also believe that their music and guitar playing was also a very meaningful factor in that learning and sharing.\nHawaiian Musicians\nSpanish music uses open tunings and the most common is known as Open G.\u00a0 It caught on fast and just as Hawaiians quickly learned to drive and herd cattle, they also learned to play the guitar and soon they creatively applied their own songs to the accompaniment.\u00a0 The fundamental Open G tuning was affectionately re-named Taro Patch, no doubt because the taro is the root of the Hawaiian people.\n\nIt is from these historical events, marking the blending of unique cultures, that Hawaiian Slack Key or K\u012bho\u02bbalu (loosening the keys) was born.\n\u00a0\n\nTo hire Hawaiian Musicians for your next event, Please take a look at our website:\nwww.HawaiiHulaCompany.com\nhttp://www.hawaiihulacompany.com/musicians.html\nFacebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Hawaii-Hula-Company/101273199967035?ref=hl#\nYou Tube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/HawaiiHulaCompany/videos\n\n\u00a0\n\t  Hire Hawaiian MusiciansHire Hawaiian MusiciansHawaiian Musicians"},

We had a nice conversation about keeping authenticity in the \u00a0cultural performance and protocols. Expedia wanted our help to create a show where the audience member would be brought up to share in the performance with our Tahitian dancers. It was to be all about the moment where a visitor is brought into a new experience and the joy that brings to someone willing to try something new.\nWe worked out the details and arrived on a very windy afternoon in Wailea. Boy, it was cold!! Our dancers, who are always professional and ever ready to share, were troopers. \u00a0Bearing their costumes like the koa (Warriors) of the Aloha Spirit they are, they dressed in a\u00a0Fisherman\u2019s wrap and Ti leaf arm and leg bands\u00a0and headed to the shooting area.\n\nOur Kane dancers\n\nThe crew was ready to shoot, and our Kane (male) Tahitian Dancers wowed the crowd with an amazing performance\u2026The audience members really got into it! One of the audience members that got pulled up into the performance took his shirt off and really gave it a go, learning quickly with our dancers!! \u00a0It was getting wild and winder!\nThe crowd loved our performances and our dancers all did such a phenomenal job at repeating a very difficult routine over and over again to get all the right shots to make the Expedia commercial a huge success! It was an amazing experience and we were all so thrilled to be a part of it. Please look out for our Hawaii Hula Company performance on an Expedia commercial to be airing near you!

Well, it is a brand New Year. Full of possibility, loaded with opportunity, singing with promise. We are all happy from the holidays and have plenty on the horizon for the new year. Here at Hawaii Hula Company, we too have many new things in the works!!!\nSometimes its good to take a step back and reflect before marching ahead. Before moving forward into a new year and all the possibilities that comes with it, let us reflect. Reflect on what it means to us as Hula dancers to practice and perpetuate our culture through Hula accompanied by mele (song) or (oli).\nWe have asked a few of our gracious dancers to share their reflections on being a Hula dancer\u2026\nKehau, Hula Dancer\n\u00a0\nHula is an art of dancing which represents culture and traditions of the Hawaiian islands. From the graceful hands, swaying hips and foot movements, people around the world have come to appreciate and admire the stories told by Hula dancing.\u00a0As a Hula dancer for so many years it has become a form of dedication, sacrifice and unconditional emotions. My deliverance of hula is very sincere to my audience, friends, family, teachers and most importantly\u2026.Ancestry. I call it an untouchable gift. During any hula songs/dancing my focus is on the connection within my self to portray the meaning. Receiving a smile or tears of joy is a reward for what I love to do.\u00a0I will continue to share the Aloha spirit and represent the art of Hula for as long as time permits.\nKehau, Hula Dancer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMahana, Hula Dance\nI started dancing as soon as I could\u2026about age 4. Growing up in a house of Hawaiian language and Hawaiian music, I actually felt like I had invented this dance because it seemed to come from deep within myself. I was lucky enough to be the youngest haumana (student) in my first H\u0101lau (Hula school), studying under Ray Fonseca in Volcano. I was a little intimidated at first but was so eager to learn and be like the older girls in the h\u0101lau, who, in a \u00a0short time became young women I very much looked up to. \u00a0Growing up dancing Hula has been a way of life for me. It taught me discipline, has taught me about our Hawaiian culture and allowed me to experience things I never dreamed\u2026Touring Aisa dancing Hula and traveling through out Taiwan and Korea, being exposed to those cultures and its people\u2026Dancing Hula solo on the Waikiki Shell stage to a crowd of thousands at the World Invitational Hula Festival\u2026And my personal favorite part of being a Hula dancer, just being able to jump up and dance a song at the drop of a hat at some laid back l\u016b\u2019au or gathering. Hula has been and will remain one of my deepest and treasured blessings.\nMahana, Hula Dancer\n\u00a0\nKawela, Hula Dancer\nWhen I first started dancing it was because my mom said so, she thought it would be good for me. So I went. That is how it was in my house. LoL. I was pretty uninterested until one day when it clicked, I was creating a visual equivalent to the sounds and music. Course, it didnt sound so eloquently put\u2013it was the inner thoughts of a 3rd grader. \u00a0Once I realized that I was telling the story of the song, it was a sense of responsibility that followed. The fact that I was in charge of \u201cpainting a picture\u201d for the story in the music, was more than I had ever been given to take care of. \u00a0It was my kuleana (responsibility/duty) and I was up for the job! Ever since then, Hula has been a part of my life. I take it with me where ever I go, I treasure the joy I can actually bring to others. It will always be something I carry in my heart, to share my heart through each and every time I perform.\nKawela, Hula Dancer\n\u00a0\nWe hope you have enjoyed hearing from some of our dancers. We welcome you to comment at the bottom. Please consider us for your next event on Maui or O\u2019ahu.

To visit here is to fall in love. To call Hawaii home is to live in love.\nWhat an honor it is truly, to live here in Hawaii. To feel the breathe of the sun kiss your cheek in the morning through the window seal, to have the gentle breeze in the evening to caress your shoulders as you take a stroll under the moonlight. \u00a0To take the day off and take off to Hana for some exploration and adventure, To be able to just take a walk and see natural beauty some wait their whole lives to witness in person. \u00a0To know Hawaii is to love her. It is out of this deep love and devotion that Hula was born.\u00a0It is for these intangible reasons a child becomes a student of Hawaii\u2026and then, and only then\u2026a Hula Dancer.\nHawaii Hula Company dancer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt takes much dedication and diligence to Learn Hula and become a\u00a0Hula\u00a0Dancer. \u00a0\u00a0I recall as a child practicing for hours to show my mother what I had learned in class but by the time she had gotten home, I was so burnt out I kept getting all the motions wrong. I knew it, but had just over done it to the maximum degree, my body just said no and my mind couldn\u2019t convince it to change its mind\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0 \u2013Kona, Hawaii Hula Company dancer\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHawaii Hula Company dancer\nThe role Hula plays in your life as a Hula dancer is hard to explain. It becomes an expression that is as important as speaking in a way. Not to say it replaces any expression, but it does add on to your primary communication habits. When you raise your hand to your mouth to gesture someone or your self was speaking or gesture to the mountains using your hands as you tell a story, you know Hula has begun to become a part of you. It is a process of learning. To learn about Hawaii and Hawaiian culture and Hawaiian language is to learn about Hula and become a better dancer. To be able to interpret the song or chant properly is to know Hawaiian language or at least have a strong grasp on it. To tell stories of Hawaii, you have to know Hawaii inside and out. Love the different aspects of each island. Know that the west side is always a little drier, the East side always a bit more lush\u2026know that the North shore experiences its surf worthy swells in the winter and the South side are the lucky surfers of the summer. You have to feel the pulse of Hawaii and its past. You have to feel the past of Hawaii\u2019s people.\n\u00a0\u2013Moana, Hawaii Hula Company dancer\n\u00a0\nHawaii Hula Company:Hula DancersTahitian DancersFire Knife DancersHawaiian Musicians\nOur Hula \u00a0dancers are born and raised in Hawai\u2019i, Halau taught and are regulars at Merrie Monarch.\u00a0\nOur Hawaiian Musicians include several Grammy award winners and N\u0101 Hoku Hanohano award winners.\u00a0\nOur Fire dancers come from generations of Fire Knife dancers and have been trained traditionally.\u00a0\nWe are commited to perpetuating the Hawaiian culture and Hawaii\u2019s people \u00a0through Hawaiian and ploynesian art forms such as: Hula Dancers, Tahitian Dancers, Hawaiian Musicians and Fire Knife Dancers.

His girlfriend, Melissa was a dancer and had a love of Hula and he wanted to incorporate that into his surprise. \u00a0He is not a dancer of any sort, he warned us, but wanted to have a Hula lesson prior to the master-minded proposal so he could surprise his girlfriend with some new moves. We plotted and planned and here\u2019s what we came up with.\nSurprise\u00a0Hawaiian Wedding proposal: THE PLAN\nFirst, We would hold a private Hula Lesson to teach Craig 1-2 verses of a song we would perform. The plan, to call him up as a participating audience member only to have him join in perfectly for the last verses. \u00a0Next we\u00a0planned the proposal. Craig and Melissa would be casually strolling Kal\u0101kaua Avenue sight-seeing and enjoying the shopping in Waikiki. They would happen to come across a street performance where 3 Hula dancers were performing. \u00a0Once we spotted Craig in the crowd we would call him up at the right time. The crowd and his girlfriend would think he was just that poor guy who was called up and will most likely embarrass himself to the amusement of all watching. He would then propose to Melissa as the crowd and our Hula dancers watched and waited for the all-important answer\u2026\nThe crowds builds\u2026\n\u00a0\nThe day of the Hawaiian Wedding proposal\nThe day came, planning and preparation were finished.

The crowds came quickly and soon it was a frenzy\u2026\nSure enough Craig and Melissa strolled up. They were enjoying the show as were a large group of visitors and locals who heard the music and upon the sight of Hula dancers, rushed over to get a glimpse of the Hawaiian Hula Show. We called for a volunteer from the audience\u2026Melissa was shocked as Craig bravely volunteered with the crowd of hopefuls. We \u201cchose\u201d Craig as our audience participant. We started the song and Melissa\u2019s jaw dropped! How did her honey know all the Hula\u00a0motions? How could he dance Hula all of a sudden?!\n\nBefore she could get over her pure shock, Craig walked toward her reaching in his back pocket\u2026She started to cry\u2026He got on his knees and asked her to be his wife\u2026The audience went crazy with glee as she said YES.\nShe says yes\u2026then there is kissing\u2026lots of kissing!:)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe happy couple\u2026\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe crowd was full of smiles and had many congratulations for the happy couple.

Soon the sisters become frightened and want to wake her, but they also fear their older sister, so they pay her to her instructions.\nWhile Pelehonuamea is sleeping, her spirit leaves her body and is drawn to the sound of chanting and merriment on the island of Kaua`i.\nWhen Pelehonuamea nears the source of the chanting, she is immediately attracted to a handsome Hawaiian chief named Lohiauipo. Lohiauipo returns the attention.\nFor several days, Pelehonuamea and Lohiauipo enjoy each others company, while Hi`iakaikapoliopele dances in the Pandanus groves of Puna with her companion, Hopoe.\nAfter many nights together, Pelehonuamea tells Lohiauipo that she must return to her homeland. Lohiauipo is heartbroken, but Pelehonuamea tells him that she will send someone to bring him to her, and then she disappears into the ocean.\nWhen Pelehonuamea awakens from her spirit-traveling sleep, she summons all of her sisters and tells them about her adventures and her new love, Lohiauipo.\u00a0 She asks her sisters if one of them could travel to Kaua`i and bring Lohiauipo back to her.\u00a0 All the sisters decline.\u00a0 They are afraid of the long journey and the numerous mo\u2019o, lizard-like water creatures who can take the form of Humans.\n\u201cHi`iaka and the Mo`o\u201d by Linda Rowell Stevens\nOnly the very young, inexperienced, and devoted Hi`iakaikapoliopele agrees to make this journey.\u00a0 She does so with Pelehonuamea\u2019s promise to guard her beloved forest of lehua trees and her companion Hopoe.\nOver the arduous journey, Hi`iakaikapoliopele as many challenges. The first challenge, which is the most deadly, takes place in the forest of Pana`ewa on the island of Hawai`i. Hi`iakaikapoliopele fights the dangerous mo\u2019o named Pana`ewa for whom the forest is named.\u00a0 She is almost killed, but she uses the sacred skirt and staff given to her by Pelehonuamea to kill Pane`ewa before it kills her.\nHi`iakaikapoliopele experiences many battles on her journey to Kaua`i, and with each battle, she becomes stronger and stronger until she eventually becomes a formidable goddess and is able to exercise the ultimate of godly powers, bringing the dead back to life.\nHi`iakaikapoliopele finds Lohiauipo on Kaua`i but the journey back to Kilauea takes longer than expected.\nWhen Hi`iakaikapoliopele finally returns to Kilauea, she discovers her impatient sister has burned her beloved lehua groves to the ground and killed Hopoe.\u00a0 Hi`iakaikapoliopele vows revenge.\u00a0 She digs a hole to connect the ocean to Pelehonuamea\u2019s sacred fires.\u00a0 Her plan \u2013 to extinguish her sister as her sister has extinguished the life of the the fragile Hopoe.\nKilauea fern photo by Kevin McCarthy\nThe pantheons of gods intervene, realizing that should either sister die, her death would wreak havoc on the natural order of life and growth.\u00a0 The gods order a truce, and the sisters agree.\nAfter the volcanoes of Pelehonuamea create new land, among the first plants to grow are the beloved lehua tree and ferns of Hi`iakaikapoliopele.\u00a0 The creation of new land is followed by the growth of new vegetation.\u00a0 These sister-gods ensure that the life of the land continues.\nSource: Akua Hawai`i\nAuthor: Kimo Armitage\nCopyright 2005, Bishop Museum\n\t  \u201cSacred Fire of Pele\u201d by Olga Shevchenko\u201cHi`iaka and the Mo`o\u201d by Linda Rowell StevensKilauea fern photo by Kevin McCarthy"}
